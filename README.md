Employees Management System

This Code Louisville project was designed to help a business manage it's employee's data online using a sql database.
A user of this application can enter employee's data via form's input fields and submit it by clicking on a button. It gets sent to the SQL database where it is stored. This application has the following features:
	Login
	Registration
	Add employee
	View employee’s details
	View All employees
	Edit employee’s records
	Delete employee’s record

The following were implemented in the project as per the requirement set out by Code Louisville.
I implemented a regular expression (regex) to validate email field on a form.

A list was created, populated with several values, retrieved at least one value.

Added comments to my code explaining how I used Interface and Dependency Injection of the solid principles.

This application is an API. 

A user can add, view(read), update and delete employee's record from the database.
